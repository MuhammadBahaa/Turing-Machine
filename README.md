# Turing-Machine
Simulation of Turing Machine

It is a task asked of us in the college , in course theory of computations, to develop an algorithm that checks accepted strings by turing Machine it is considered as simple compiler , the code is in C++ ,I used some structures in a program like queue and vector .My professor appreciated of algorithm and said it is a new idea of implementation .
